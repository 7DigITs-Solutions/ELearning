Java operators: In any programming language (and in mathematics), we use some symbols to represent an operation (calculation).
Suppose if we want to perform an addition, then we use the symbol
  ” + “ Similarly, when we want to perform a subtraction, then we use the symbol  ” – “ These symbols are known as mathematical operators. We have different  types of operators in java. Each type (group) has some symbols (operators) in it.

Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups –

1.	Arithmetic Operators
2.	Relational Operators
3.	Bitwise Operators
4.	Logical Operators
5.	Assignment Operators
6.	Misc Operators
